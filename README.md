# New feature

## I added information about myself to this project and also slightly changed the position of the buttons on the site


To start the project, you need to install django first.
`pip3 install django`

then to open the project on the Internet you need to go to the taskmanager folder
`cd taskmanager`

and finally we open the project on the server
`python3 manage.py runserver`
